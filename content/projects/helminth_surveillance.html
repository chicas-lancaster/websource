<p>
Soil-transmitted helminths (STH) and schistosomiasis are neglected
tropical diseases caused by infection of parasitic worms, primarily in
low-middle income countries. As part of their Deworm the World
programme, we are collaborating with Evidence Action to provide
governments in India, Nigeria, Kenya and Pakistan with data-driven
evidence to inform policy for treatment and surveillance. We use
geostatistics to evaluate the impact of mass drug administration and
compare survey designs to find the most cost-effective approach to
surveillance.
