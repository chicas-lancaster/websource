Hydrocephalus is one of the most common neurosurgical disorders in
children, resulting in abnormal expansion of the cerebral
ventricles. Given the severity of the disease and the requirement of
surgery for treatment, timely and accurate diagnosis are important,
particularly in resource-limited settings such as Uganda. We consider
three categories of hydrocephalus:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>hydrocephalus due to
    myelomeningocele (spina bifida)</li>
  <li>post-infectious hydrocephalus
    (PIH), and</li>
  <li>non-post-infectious hydrocephalus (NPIH), which is
    caused by neural defects at birth other than myelomeningocele.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
This
project aims to predict the incidence of each category of
hydrocephalus cases among children in Uganda. This is a collaborative
effort that includes researchers with a wide range of expertise from
Penn State University, Yale University, and the National Planning
Authority of Uganda.
</p>
<p>
We develop inhomogeneous Poisson point process models, using the data
collected over a 20-year period by the CURE Childrenâ€™s Hospital of
Uganda in Mbale on infants with hydrocephalus. The spatiotemporal
distribution of cases within the population shows evidence of
inhomogeneity. For PIH, an observed increase in cases during the rainy
season leads to the hypothesis that the distribution of the bacteria
is related to rainfall. For myelomeningocele, folate deficiency during
pregnancy has been previously identified as a risk factor. It is
suspected that crop failure in Uganda may be associated with folate
deficiency. Our work investigates the association between the
spatio-temporal pattern of hydrocephalus cases and several such
environmental and socio-demographic factors to test these
hypotheses. Ultimately, we aim to use our model to instruct policy on
preventative measures for areas identified as high-risk, and to
identify the most probable cause of disease to inform treatment at
point-of-care using real-time data.
