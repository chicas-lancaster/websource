<p>
In almost any geostatistical analysis, one of the underlying, often
implicit, modelling assumptions is that the spatial locations, where
measurements are taken, are recorded without error. In this project we
aim at developing geostatistical inference when this assumption is not
valid. This is often the case when, for example, individual address
information is randomly altered to provide privacy protection
(geomasking) or imprecisions are induced by geocoding processes and
measurement devices.
