Human exposure risk to onchocerciasis can only be partly described by
measuring entomological indices at blackfly breeding sites, where most
of the entomological surveillance has taken/takes place, but where
only a proportion of the at-risk human population is found. As some
vector species have been found at up to 40 km from breeding sites it
is therefore also necessary to survey blackflies at various distances
from breeding sites, as well as across finer spatial scales within
village settings.
</p><p>
  The aim of this project is to support vector biting rate
modelling in onchocerciasis transmission models by providing more
accurate and up-to-date field-derived data on variations in exposure
driven by blackfly biting, parity, and infection rates across
different spatial scales. The project also aims to calibrate new
blackfly sampling methods to give confidence in their uptake at
programmatic levels to enhance elimination surveillance and Stop MDA
survey quality.

  The results will respond directly to stakeholder needs and
support onchocerciasis surveillance and intervention programmes by
filling in important gaps in our understanding of the entomological
components of transmission dynamics away from breeding sites.
