During the 2012 and 2013 meningitis years, the CHICAS (Lancaster) team
conducted an empirical evaluation of statistical model-based
forecasting algorithms using weekly district-level incidence data from
Benin, Burkina Faso, Chad, Nigeria, Senegal and Togo. The team had
previously developed the statistical models by analysing an
exceptionally long and complete twenty-two year (1986 to 2007)
time-series of weekly district-level incidence in Niger.

We used the weekly numbers of new cases in each district and an
estimate of the population size of each district to help predict the
probability that each district would experience a 'meningitis alert'
(5 cases per 100,000), or an 'epidemic alert' (10 cases per 100,000)
either within the next few weeks or in the current meningitis
season. We used the technique of dynamic linear modelling to deliver
the required inferences; our research was shared via teleconferences
with the World Health Organization on a weekly basis.
