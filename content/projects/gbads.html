<p>
GBADS will measure and improve societal outcomes from livestock and
have a positive impact on the sustainable development goals
contributing to a world in which there is zero hunger, good health and
well-being, gender equality, decent work and economic growth and
responsible consumption and production.

<p>
Livestock health and productivity are negatively impacted by the
presence of endemic and emerging diseases, increasing the amount of
resources needed to maintain these animals, which in turn increases
competition for land, air and water. In response, hundreds of millions
of dollars are invested globally on disease mitigation in order to
improve livestock health and productivity, yet a systematic process to
determine the burden of animal disease on the health and wellbeing of
people is not available. It is unknown how the burden is apportioned
between smallholders and the commercial sector, by region and
gender. Consequently, decision makers lack the information to
accurately assess whether their investments target the animal health
issues that have the most significant impact on human wellbeing.
