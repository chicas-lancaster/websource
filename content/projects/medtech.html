  This evaluation aims to assess “the efficacy and safety of using
technology-enabled smart medication devices to manage medication
adherence.” The project will focus on use of such devices as part of
a domiciliary care package to determine whether this provides an
effective and time and cost saving solution to the social care
recipient, the care provider and local authorities, and improves
medication adherence and independence. The evaluation will explore
benefits, facilitators, barriers and cost impacts of employing such
devices, with an emphasis on what works for whom and what contextual
factors or mechanisms may make it work. Lancaster University has
well-established links with the ICS and more recently the ICB,
working closely together for a number of years. This partnership has
allowed identification of academic researchers with expertise in
evaluations, in technology implementation, prevention of negative
outcomes amongst older and frailer people, in health economics, and
in social/organisational aspects of technology and healthcare, all
related to this proposed evaluation, facilitating identification of
Lancaster University as a credible evaluation partner for this
project.
