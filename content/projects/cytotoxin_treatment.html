Kofi Annan called snakebite “the biggest public health crisis you’ve
never heard of”; killing over 100,000 people yearly and maiming
approximately 400,000, it remains one of the most neglected of
neglected tropical diseases. In recent years the World Health
Organization (WHO) has labelled snakebite a Priority Neglected
Tropical Disease with the goal of halving the global burden of
snakebite by 2030. Our snakebite research, completed in collaboration
with the Centre for Snakebite Research & Interventions at the
Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, revolves around the development
of novel snakebite therapies with a particular focus on synergistic
small molecule drug combinations and their translation into suitable
formulations for the treatment of local tissue destruction caused by
cytotoxic snake venoms.
