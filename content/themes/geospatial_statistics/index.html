<p>
The geospatial statistics theme covers the development of statistical
methodology motivated by and applied to problems in population health
research where the locations of health outcomes in geographical space
play an important role in their interpretation. The group works in
both developed and developing country settings, but has a global
health focus that is pursued through strong collaborative links with
low and middle income countries in Africa, South America and southern
Asia.
