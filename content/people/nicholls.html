resolution of ground based telescopes using adaptive optics.  Since
then he has held a variety of posts in software engineering and
software consultancy in industry and has also previously worked as a
software trainer.  From 2019, Tom spent 3 years in Lancaster in the

between academic or "by-the-book" software development and efficient
methods of building projects quickly.
