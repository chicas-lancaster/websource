<p>
Trystan is an infectious disease epidemiologist and mathematical
modeller. He joined Lancaster and CHICAS in 2025 to undertake a
Wellcome Early Career Award fellowship. His current research focuses
on understanding the impact of school-level pathogen control
strategies, with impact defined broadly.
</p>
<p>
In previous roles he has used modelling to evaluate a range of public
health interventions, including the cost-effectiveness of vaccination
for gonorrhoea control, the cost-effectiveness of HIV pre-exposure
prophylaxis, the impact of rapid SARS-CoV-2 testing in schools, and
the impact of social bubbling as a SARS-CoV-2 lockdown exit
strategy. He obtained his PhD, on network approaches to modelling
epidemics in human populations, from the University of Warwick in
2021.
</p>
<p>
More generally, he is interested in outbreak control in structured
populations, how these population structures influence epidemic
dynamics and intervention effectiveness, and how/whether structural
assumptions in models impact their predictions. He is also
increasingly interested in understanding the broader societal impacts
of epidemic control and how best to incorporate these impacts into
epidemiological/health-economic frameworks to inform policy.
