I am a PhD student at Lancaster University, supervised by Jo Knight
and Nicola Rennie. My research focuses on federated analytics within
the NHS, specifically looking at methods for standardising and
analysing health data. In addition to my studies, I work full-time as
a Data Scientist at Lancashire Teaching Hospitals.

I hold a BSc (Hons) in Mathematics and Statistics from the Open
University, and an MSc in Health Data Science from Lancaster
University.
