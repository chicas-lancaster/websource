  Mark has now finished his PhD studies. Old content follows:

<p>
  I am currently a 2nd year PhD student investigating the role of
  MR-based water exchange imaging in determining blood-brain barrier
  dysfunction in patients with cerebrovascular disease. My supervisors
  are Prof. Hedley Emsley and Prof. Jo Knight. This is funded by a
  multi-centre EPSRC sponsored grant.
</p>
<p>
I completed my undergraduate training in Medicine at University of
Manchester, followed by Foundation Training at Salford Royal. I was
then appointed to an NIHR Academic Clinical Fellowship in Neurology
and pursued an MSc in Clinical Research at Lancaster
University. During this time, I undertook a pre-clinical research
project focussing on the use of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor
agonists (GLP-1RAs) in an Alzheimer's Disease model supervised by
Prof. Christian Holscher and then applied this to a clinical
systematic review of GLP-1RAs in the management of acute stroke
patients.

<p>
I am associate member of the Association of British Neurologists and
serve on the European Academy of Neurology Scientific Panel for
Stroke. I am regularly involved with the education of undergraduate
and post graduate students.
