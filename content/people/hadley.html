Lucie is a postdoctoral researcher in Biostatistics and a current
member of CHICAS. She joined CHICAS in February 2022 as a new and
meaningful research direction to suit her skill set following the
completion of her PhD work on statistical modelling for wireless
communication systems. She completed her PhD under the supervision of
Dr. Ioannis Chatzigeorgiou as part of Lancaster's School of Computing
and Communications, before winning the prestigious 'EPSRC Doctoral
Prize' and spending a year extending her postdoctoral work under the
supervision of Dr. Natasha Blitvic as a member of Lancaster's
Department of Mathematics and Statistics from 2021-22.

<p>
Her research interests are in the development of new computational
methods applying spatio-temporal statistical models to map the spread
of tropical diseases.
