Gemma is a vet and epidemiologist and has experience working on
livestock movements, social network analysis and zoonotic disease
transmission in Tanzania. She is interested in the impacts of zoonoses
on human health and how improved livestock health can be used to help
people in the worlds most marginalised communities move out of and
away from poverty.

Gemma's recent as analyst for the Global Burden of Animal Diseases
(GBADs) programme has involved collaborating across disciplines
including Wider Economics, Informatics and Human Health, developing
models for use across the programme and supporting the programmes case
studies in Ethiopia, Senegal and Indonesia. GBADs strives to provide
information for decision makers on the impacts of livestock ill-health
on livestock production and the resulting socio-economic and
environmental consequences. Clearer information on the impacts of
livestock ill-health will provide decision makers with the power to
advocate for more efficient spending to improve livestock health and
thus wider societal health and well being.
