I am Heba Ali, a Senior Research Associate in the Health Economics
Department at DHR. I have a background in health and healthcare
research. Trained as a physician, I practiced for a few years before
transitioning into research. I hold a master’s degree in Health
Economics and a PhD in Health Policy. My research interests focus on
healthcare delivery, including studies on team coordination, quality
of care, provider well-being, and the impact of public policies on
patient outcomes. I’m currently working on an evaluation study of a
AI-enabled MedTech device installed in care homes to detect resident
falls and rapidly alert staff to intervene.
