I am a Health Research PhD student within the CHICAS group and
Spectrum Centre for Mental Health Research at Lancaster University. My
PhD is funded by the Economic and Social Research Council, as part of
the North West Social Science Doctoral Training Partnership.

My PhD project investigates healthcare use, interventions, and
longer-term outcomes for people with co-occurring bipolar and alcohol
use disorder, using local and national routinely collected healthcare
data. My project is supervised by Dr Laura Goodwin, Dr Anastasia
Ushakova, and Prof. Steven Jones.
