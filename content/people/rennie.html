<p>
Nicola Rennie is a Lecturer in Health Data Science, joining CHICAS in 2023. Her current research focus is in applications of statistics related to health. She is also interested in thinking about how we communicate statistics - both to members of the public, and within the context of teaching statistics. Nicola's previous research developed methodology for identifying outliers in functional data, with a focus on data collected at overlapping intervals across a network structure. This research had a strong focus on applicability, with case studies relating to public transport - particularly railways and bike-sharing networks. Nicola also has experience in data science consultancy, and enjoys collaborating closely with external research partners.
