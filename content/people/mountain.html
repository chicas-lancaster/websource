</p>
<p>
I am a Statistics and Epidemiology PhD student in CHICAS supervised by
Prof. Jo Knight and Dr Emanuele Giorgi. I am funded by the Economic
and Social Research Council (ESRC) via the North West Social Science
Doctoral Training Partnership (NWSSDTP). My PhD is in partnership with
University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay.

<p>
My research is focused on chronic respiratory disease care in the
Morecambe Bay area and aims to evaluate the clinical benefits of the
Morecambe Bay Respiratory Network (MBRN), a local integrated care
initiative established in 2017. The objectives of my research are to 
utilise routinely collected healthcare data to develop:
<ol>
  <li>spatio-temporal models for outpatient referrals</li>
  <li>classification algorithms to understand the features of diagnostic quality;</li>
  <li>models for predicting how well patients control their symptoms following initial diagnoses.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
I hold an MSc in Statistics and a BSc in Mathematics, both from Lancaster University.
