<p>
I am a DTP candidate based at Lancaster University, linked to Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine.
</p><p>
I studied Biology before completing a postgraduate qualification in Infection and Immunity, then trained as a Physician Associate and worked in clinical practice for seven years. This experience gave me valuable insight into health inequalities and the realities of working within health systems.
</p><p>
To strengthen my public health knowledge, I have just completed a Master's in Public Health (Outbreak Control and Health Protection) at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, which brought together my clinical and academic training. 
</p><p>
My current research focuses on modelling the global spread and evolution of human viral infections, with a particular focus on reviewing viral evolution and transmission, and developing models to test pandemic preparedness.
</p><p>
I also have broader interests in biodiversity and the role of the natural environment in shaping human and animal health.
