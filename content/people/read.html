<p>
I am an infectious disease epidemiologist, with a background in
ecology and theoretical biology. My research is focused on improving
our understanding of infectious disease transmission and evolution,
with the aim of improving epidemic models and informing control
strategies and policies. A substantial part of this interest lies in
understanding the structure of human social networks, and in
identifying risk factors for transmission, through fieldwork and
secondary data analysis. I am particularly interested in how realistic
models of contagious processes need to be to explain and predict
incidence patterns and yet also be useful in epidemic emergencies. My
research includes the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2, seasonal and
pandemic influenza, RSV, Ebola, pneumococcal infection, rotavirus,
norovirus, as well as other respiratory viruses.
