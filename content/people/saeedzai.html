I am currently a research fellow at Lancaster University. My
responsibilities include conducting comprehensive analyses using
secondary data from national surveys and qualitative interviews,
alongside NHS routine data analysis. I work under the direct
supervision of Jo Knight. My academic background includes an MD degree
in medicine and an MSc in Epidemiology and Biostatistics from Aga Khan
University.

  Specializing in public health, I focus on disease
surveillance, monitoring & evaluation, and health systems
strengthening. In leadership roles at MoPH and various international
organizations in Afghanistan, I led impactful initiatives, notably
during health crises like Covid-19. I led numerous national surveys
and research studies in collaboration with international universities
  in Afghanistan.
