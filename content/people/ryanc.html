  Cían trained as a medical scientist in Ireland, specialising in
immunology and medical microbiology before joining CHICAS to train as
an epidemiologist under the supervision of Dr Jonathan Read and Dr
Chris Jewell. He aims to employ network modelling and bayesian
inference approaches alongside his knowledge of infectious diseases to
investigate how susceptible individuals connect at multiple scales and
how this impacts disease transmission across geo-social space. Before
beginning his PhD with CHICAS, Cían was working briefly with the UK
Health Security Agency on the outbreak response to emergencies such as
the COVID-19 pandemic (omicron) and Monkeypox.
