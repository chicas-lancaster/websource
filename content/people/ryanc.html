<p>
Cían trained as a medical scientist in Ireland, specialising in blood
science and medical microbiology before joining CHICAS to become an
epidemiologist under the mentorship of Dr. Jonathan Read, Dr. Sam
Moore, and Prof. Chris Jewell. His research integrates computational
statistical methods and infectious disease dynamic modelling with his
knowledge of infectious diseases to study how connections between
susceptible individuals influence disease transmission across
geographical and social space.
</p>

<p>Cían is particularly interested in analysing contact pattern data
from the COVID-19 pandemic to understand the network connections among
different demographic groups. He plans to conduct mathematical
simulations of infectious disease outbreaks using real network data
from the English population to examine patterns of infectious spread,
identify vulnerable groups, and assess the impact of vaccine hesitancy
on the transmission of vaccine-preventable diseases.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, Cían investigates vaccine hesitancy through statistical
modelling to map and quantify it across different geographical and
social contexts in England.
</p>
<p>
Prior to starting his PhD with CHICAS, Cían worked briefly with the UK
Health Security Agency on emergency outbreak responses, including the
COVID-19 pandemic and the Mpox epidemic. He remains an honorary
researcher with the UKHSA, which collaborates on his research
projects.
