<p>
  I am a Health Data Science PhD Student within the CHICAS group,
  completing a project under the supervision of Dr Anastasia Ushakova
  and Prof. Jo Knight.
</p>
<p>
My project is in collaboration with Lancashire and South Cumbria
National Health Service (NHS) Foundation Trust (LSCFT) and involves
using/developing Causal Inference methods in order to identify the
driving forces behind patients' mental health needs and outcomes. My
research interests lie mostly within the field of applied statistics,
and I enjoy using methods with a strong spatio-temporal, longitudinal
and inferential focus.
</p>
<p>
Prior to beginning my PhD within the CHICAS research group, I
completed a Bachelor's in Mathematics and Statistics at the University
of Strathclyde, before undertaking a Master's in Data Science at
Lancaster University. During this time, I had the opportunity to
further explore my interests in Health Data Science through my
research project on the identification of common risk factors between
Leptospirosis and Chikungunya within urban areas of Salvador, Brazil.
