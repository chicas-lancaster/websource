I completed my PhD in Statistics and Epidemiology in the CHICAS
research group in the Lancaster Medical School and am now working
within the NHS as a Post Doctoral Researcher in Neurology Data
Science. My research focuses on ways we can use routinely collected
health data to help improve health services. I am currently exploring
how visualising data pathways can help identify where health data is
stored and how it is accessed.
</p>
<p>
My interests lie in using patient data to improve health outcomes. A
large amount of medical and administrative data is recorded as a
patient moves though the medical system, and with some careful
analysis this data can also be used in research. Understanding issues
such as care pathways, patterns of diagnosis and referral can inform
potential changes in services which, in turn, can enable better
patient care.
</p>
<p>
Alongside my research I also volunteer as a STEM ambassador, visiting
schools and colleges to talk about data and research. I have helped to
run introduction to data science workshops, talked about my
experiences at careers seminars, and also judged STEM competitions
such as the First Lego League, which encourages young students to get
involved in STEM subjects.
